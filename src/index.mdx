# The Tutorial

This tutorial teaches you what you need to know to:

1. build React applications using Starbeam
2. build reusable Starbeam code that you could use in React or any other framework with a Starbeam renderer.

## Lessons

1. [Getting Started]: Build a simple counter using `@starbeam/react`.
2. [Computed Data]: Learn how to use normal JavaScript functions to compute data and use them in
   your React components. We'll add a second counter to our example and show the sum of the two
   counters.
3. [Reactive Builtins]: Learn how to use `reactive.object` to group multiple reactive values together
   in an object that has the same API as a normal JavaScript object. We'll update our counters to
   use a reactive object to store their state.
4. [Reactive Arrays]: Learn how to use `reactive.array` to create a reactive array. We'll update our
   counters to use an array to store their state.
   a. [Reactive Arrays Bonus]: This bonus lesson builds on the reactive arrays lesson to add support
   for an arbitrary number of counters, and a way to add new counters.
5. [Custom Reactive Objects]: Learn how to create your own reactive objects. We'll create a reactive
   object that stores the state of a counter, and use it in our counter component.
6. [Custom Reactive Objects Using a Class]: Learn how to create your own reactive objects using a
   native JavaScript class. This is the same as the previous lesson, but uses a class instead of a
   plain object. We support both styles, and you can choose whichever you prefer.
7. [Resources]: Leaarn how to create custom reactive objects that need to be cleaned up when they're
   no longer needed. In this example, we'll switch gears and build a simple component that
   shows a clock that updates every second. Under the hood, it will use a `Clock` resource that will
   keeps itself up to date using a `setInterval`, and automatically clean itself up when the
   component is unmounted. Buckle in, this is where it starts to get interesting!
